This folder contains graphs of per task input data size, per machine amount of
data and number of preference arcs for various DFS setups. We studied two
distributed file systems:
1) a uniform DFS in which the blocks are randomly placed in the cluster.
2) a DFS in which the blocks are placed on a pool of machines equal to three
times the number of tasks.
